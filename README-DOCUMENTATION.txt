The image in the Home page is generated by midjourney and can not be shared
comercially that is why I have provided placeholder image instead. For your
personal projects you can generate the image you want using midjourney and 
replace it with the placeholder image. The steps to generate such image is 
shown in the video and also prompt is given in the public folder via prompts.txt file.
